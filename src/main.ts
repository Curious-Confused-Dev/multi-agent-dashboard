// This file is the entry point for the Angular application.
// It bootstraps the root component (App) with the provided configuration (appConfig).
// The appConfig can include providers, imports, and other settings necessary for the application to run. 
// The bootstrapApplication function initializes the application and handles any errors that may occur during the bootstrapping process.

// Note: Ensure that the appConfig is defined in the app.config.ts file, which should include necessary providers and imports for the application.
// The App component is the root component of the application, which is defined in app.ts.
// The bootstrapApplication function is part of the Angular platform-browser package, which allows for bootstrapping Angular applications without the need for a full NgModule setup.
// This approach is suitable for standalone components and applications that do not require a traditional NgModule structure.
// The application is configured to use the ES2022 target and the Preserve module system, as specified in the project's TypeScript configuration.
// The TypeScript version used is 5.8.3, which is compatible with the features used in this application.
// The application is designed to be modular and scalable, allowing for easy addition of new components and features in the future. 
// The application is structured to follow best practices in Angular development, ensuring maintainability and readability.
// The application is expected to run in a modern browser environment that supports ES2022 features.
// The application can be extended with additional features such as routing, state management, and more, as needed.
// The use of standalone components allows for a more flexible and modular architecture, making it easier to manage dependencies and component interactions.
// The application is designed to be responsive and user-friendly, providing a seamless experience across different devices and screen sizes.
// The application can be tested using Angular's testing utilities, ensuring that components and services work as expected.
// The application is ready for deployment, with the necessary configurations in place for production builds.
// The application can be easily integrated with other Angular libraries and tools, enhancing its functionality and performance.
// The application follows Angular's best practices for performance optimization, including lazy loading, change detection strategies, and more.
